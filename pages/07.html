        Do you play any other instruments? If so, which?

        The next and final part of the study is a brief listening test, consisting of eight isolated tones for you to identify. A tone will play for a moment, and then you will have five seconds to click the note name (such as C, C#/Db, D, etc.) that best fits the tone. Don't be afraid to make a best guess if you are unsure&mdash;it's better to guess than not to respond at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you're ready to begin the listening test, click to continue. The buttons will appear, and the first tone will begin playing automatically.
