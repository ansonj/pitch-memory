1. Introduction and consent to participate
1. "Rules" page
    - Isolate sounds, work in a quiet space.
    - No humming, singing, or whistling.
    - Set volume to a low level.  Better to start off quiet than loud.
1. First task page
    - Display a graphic that shows Cs in various octaves.
    - Ask — without any external sounds or audible vocalization — to imagine what the note C sounds like.
    - When ready, click "Ready," and the tone generator (sine wave) will begin.
    - Move the tone generator to match the pitch of the imagined C.
    - When done, click "Done."
    - Record the Hz for this task.
1. Intermediate page
    - Ask for demographic information (and record it).
        - Age and gender (text boxes, not buttons).
        - Primary instrument.  For how long have they played the instrument, how often do they play (roughly), when was the last time they played?
        - If the primary instrument is voice, specify the vocal range (e.g., mezzo, tenor).
1. Prep page for second task
    - No images displayed.
    - Ask to imagine — without any external sounds or audible vocalization — playing their primary instrument.  They are encouraged to move their bodies as they imagine playing the instrument.
    - Maybe set a time for this page and then move on?  Or maybe let the participant click when they're ready to go on?
1. Second task page
    - Display the graphic that shows Cs in various octaves.
    - Ask — without any external sounds or audible vocalization — to imagine what the note C sounds like on their primary instrument.
        - I hope they will go with the pitch on their instrument and not "concert C."
    - When ready, click "Ready," and the tone generator (sine wave) will begin.
    - Move the tone generator to match the pitch of the imagined C on their primary instrument.
    - When done, click "Done."
    - Record the Hz for this task.
1. Intermediate page
    - Ask if they play any other instruments (and record).
    - Inform that there will be a brief listening test to finish the study.  They will hear eight isolated tones, and they are to choose what label (C, C#/Db, D, etc.) best fits the tone.  They will have only five seconds to record a response — try to respond even if unsure!
1. Final task page
    - Display 12 buttons that correspond to the 12 pitch classes.
    - Play 4 sounds in the treble register (chosen from F4 up to G5, not including C5) and then 4 sounds in the bass register (Chosen from F2 up to G3, not including C3).
    - After each sound is played, give a set time (5 seconds?) for a response.  Then go to the next sound.
